## Project Consistency & Cleanup Checklist

### 1. Consistency Refactor
[ ] Refactor all headings, subheadings, and body text to use unified `Heading`, `Subheading`, and `Body` components (especially in components/features/services/)
[ ] Standardize all button and badge usage to use unified components
[ ] Remove direct Tailwind typography classes from feature and section files

### 2. Orphaned/Unused Elements
[ ] Run script/tool to find unused files in components/ and app/components/
[ ] Run ts-prune or eslint-plugin-unused-imports to find unused exports
[ ] Remove or archive orphaned files and dead code

### 3. Performance Improvements
[ ] Audit and optimize all images in public/images/
[ ] Use Next.js <Image /> for images where possible
[ ] Lazy load/code split heavy or below-the-fold components (e.g., BlogResources, InteractiveQuiz)
[ ] Extract repeated SVGs into shared components or use SVG sprites
[ ] Memoize or virtualize large lists/grids if needed
